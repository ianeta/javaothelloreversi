#summary Implementation

= Introduction =

The implementation is done in the Java language. This project may host more than one implementation of the game.

= Details =

A sub-folder nOth1(nothize's Othello 1) is made under the trunk to have a separate namespace so that it will be easier to add another implementation in another sub-folder easier in the future.

== Sample screen ==

Below is the first draft of the Othello board output in console mode. The idea of using '.', 'X', 'O' as empty, black, white is brought from the Othello game I wrote a decade ago using Pascal. That idea was borrowed from the tic-tac-toe game of the use of cross and circle while dot was designed to visualize the empty slots.

== TDD(Test-Driven Development) ==

Ricky Liu has proposed a development method - Test-Driven Development. This has long been a dream to me whilst lacking of practical experience. So it's worth to try it here.

But, where to start? [http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html Here] reveals some information.
